This is just a program I wrote in like ten minutes to help my grandma find if this list had duplicates. It would've been faster to import collections and go with something like 
print [item for item, count in collections.Counter(original).items() if count > 1],
But I'm tired and hate using import collections for anything ever. (pls don't sue me)

TLDR Code is awful, but quick enough and gets the job done.
Though tbh using Replit means that nothing is real code, so don't worry about it! (Don't quote me on that).
